# Lejos Mindstorm project for 598EA

Ran into major bug where playing sound file randomly crashes the program.
It seems to be caused by a library function.
As a result, we have 2 versions.

`master`: Plays beeps.
`unstable`: Original intended functionality with "hammertime" but crashes randomly when playing sound.
